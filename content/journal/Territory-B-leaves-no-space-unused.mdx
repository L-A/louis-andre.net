This is a
short article about Territory B, the second series in my ongoing
explorations about different aspects of what "space" can mean.

# B?

The
series' predecessor, Territory A, delved into the idea of occupying
time as it moves forward. Territory B's focus is about maximalist use of
space – whether it ends up being efficient sharing or outsized greed.

It's inspired by societal artifacts like ad-laden web pages, British land division, disk space tools, and [wild posting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyposting).

# Division, unity

Territory
B applies a sort of kitchen-sink approach to filling out a composition.
It subdivides a grid, then throws everything at it to get the space
filled out.

The
underlying noise source, however, is unified and continuous. Just like
land division, the separations created in Territory B are ultimately
artificial. Its compositions usually let the viewer see *through*
the large blocks and feel the underlying field. Some elements describe
it through angles and alignment, others by crowding certain areas.

# Exposed features

Six named features describe some of the main behaviors in each iteration:

**Palette name, and palette variant** expose the choice of colors in a composition, and whether it is reduced to a subset of its colors.

**Small blocks** means the composition will not allow larger subdivisions to exist inside its grid.

**No padding** crowds out the space by completely cutting off the possible spacing between each block.

Squeeze cross axis will pick a main and secondary axis, then significantly increase the amount of possible rows or columns on the secondary one.

**Color fill type** is usually Block,
meaning each block in the grid selects its color for its own fill
patterns. Some iterations make an exception to this and have the Precise value instead, where each individual segment drawn by the script picks its own color from the underlying noise source.

# Block types

Territory
B has six global fill types that it applies to blocks in each
iteration. The underlying field influences the block choice, making
similar styles crowd together.

Three types are sub-grids that use
rectangles, circles and lines to fill out. These types sometimes react
to the field by picking element sizes or line angles based on its
strength.

Two types fill out with a focal point – one centering on
another rectangle inside the block, and the other drawing rays from the
focal point to the edges of the block. The offset of the focal point is
driven by the value field.

The sixth type is pointillism. The distribution of dots will often conform to and reveal the underlying field as well.

# Release

The collection was released [on fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/territory-b "Territory B on fxhash") on Tuesday, March 7th, at noon on Atlantic time.
