_Maps for grief_ is a generative art project, published on the [Art blocks](https://www.artblocks.io) platform. It explores the notion of togetherness without contact. As
with most series, I find it ties together many projects and techniques
I've done in the last two years. Let's look at a few of the building
blocks behind it.

It released on January 11th, 2022, and minted 500 pieces. You can see the project [on Artblocks here](https://www.artblocks.io/project/235). The above image is test mint #12 on the Ropsten network.

## Convergence

![Convergence - untitled #1](/journal/maps-for-grief/Convergence-untitled-1.png)

One of the first generators I've made and deeply liked is called _Convergence_. It uses a simple flow field to create undulating clusters of lines, then peppers them with small blooms of circles.

It's
the result of several explorations on flow fields and branching graphs.
Eventually, it became the foundation on which I created Maps for grief.

## Glitches

The
idea behind Convergence's blooms comes back in a lot of my
explorations, where I tend to establish a certain structure in the
piece, then add odd parts that are less conforming to it. Internally,
they're usually called glitches or anomalies.

Sometimes the anomalies themselves become the main subject for the piece, as is the case with Glitch circles.

Other
times, they bring variety and interest into a structure that would be
too rigorous or monotonous on its own. The following was an exploration of purely using anomalies, turning a simple composition into something interesting by inserting "mistakes" in the drawing process:

Maps for grief rests
on the same technique of creating, then breaking, a given composition.
At its core, each iteration tries to draw lines that flow side by side
and never touch. However, these lines run into areas that dry them out,
and force them to shorten, sometimes turning into clusters of anomalies
when the secondary force is strong enough.

## Topography

Architecture
and natural structures are among the influences I can see repeatedly in
my work. While they can be seen as competing aesthetics, I find that
disciplines like urbanism and cartography have built a vast repertoire
of work that reconciles the two.

_Maps for grief_ leans
heavily on a more flowing, nature-like composition, yet it inherits a
lot (visually and technically) from explorations like _Urbanisms_ or _Boroughs_.

## Pen-like tracing

![Scratched circles](/journal/maps-for-grief/Scratched-circles.png)

Early
in my generative art explorations, I started building a plotter-like
library to trace lines in an organic way. It's nothing very fancy – it
follows basic lines and shapes, and sputters along the way, resembling
what pen ink would do on rough paper. You can find deeper explorations
on the topic over on [Sighack's Fifteen ways to draw a line](https://sighack.com/post/fifteen-ways-to-draw-a-line).
Over time, the rough line style became a recurring part of my practice,
and it's now uncommon for me to build sketches that don't feature this
kind of hand-drawn quality to the shapes.

_Maps for grief_
includes an agressively minimized version of the technique – at the data
level, each iteration is distilled down to a list of colored circles,
which are then traced on-screen to form the lines and shapes. The small
jitter is part of the drawing routine, which is why it's possible to
make the sketch gently animate without updating the data (press a on the keyboard when on the live viewer).

## Quick notes on the long-form format

This is my second-ish foray into [long-form generative art](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2021/the-rise-of-long-form-generative-art), a term coined by Tyler Hobbs to describe generative art that is created for direct distribution (the generator script is part of the art being delivered to viewers) and uncurated generation (the collector and the artist both discover what a specific iteration looks like at the moment it is sold and created).

The
benefits and constraints of this form have already been discussed and
laid out by others including Tyler, so I will simply talk about what I
resonated with while building Maps for grief.

### Subtle variations, less variability

The necessity for all long-form outputs to remain above a certain level of quality means that
there is less of a "conversation" between the artist and the possible
outputs at the end of the project. When manually curating runs, I can
tolerate a certain rate of "failed" outputs that are either
uninteresting or too chaotic and wild. With the tolerance afforded by
manual curation, I get to explore a wider range of these possible
outputs, including the interesting extremes, the good middle-ground.
While I can keep the interesting extremes, at the same time, I get to
discard the uninteresting extremes. With uncurated generation, all
variability has to be constrained into a "good middle" instead. Which
leads us into the second point:

### This work requires a different kind of critical view

I
found the project hard on my perceived critical sense as an artist.
When judging curated series, the quality of the series is defined by the
best iterations, which I pick out manually. Over time, this work
accumulates as a corpus of past series, each of which remains
represented by the best iterations I selected from it.

As I
explore and build on previous work, the level of quality I refer back to
is this running average of the "highs" from each project. Consciously
or not, I weigh each series against it.

With long-form art, the series' quality is suddenly defined by the average of all its iterations, and how remarkable the best iterations are, and how "uninteresting" the least interesting iterations are. It's been
difficult to recalibrate my perspective on output quality until I could
bring the variability and features to a good place across the board.

## Some example outputs

Here are a few iterations I shared from the Ropsten (test network) mints.
